Crawl a site's website:

1. Inspect the HTML of the website you want to crawl.
2. Access the website URL using the code and download the entire HTML content of the page.
3. Format downloaded content into a readable format.
4. Extract useful information and save it in a structured format.
5. For information displayed on multiple pages of the site, it may be necessary to repeat steps 2 through 4 to obtain complete information.

save the images and text from the site:
1. In order to complete this simple task, you’ll need a web scraper that can collect the URLs in question. ParseHub is a free and incredibly powerful web scraper.
2. After downloading ParseHub, make sure you have it up and running on your computer.
3. Get the specific URL of the page we will be scraping.
4. In ParseHub, click on “New Project” and enter the URL from the website that we will be scraping.
5. The webpage will now render in ParseHub and you will be able to choose the images you want to scrape.
6. Since these images also act as links to the product pages, ParseHub is extracting both the image URL and the link it is pointing to (product page). As a result, we will delete the URL selection from the left sidebar and only keep the image selection.
7. Now ParseHub will scrape every image URL for the first page of results.
